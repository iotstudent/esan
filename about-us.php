                        <p>The Association of Esan Professionals (AEP), is a socio-cultural and nonpartisan body, established in February 2001; made up of distinguished Esan sons and daughters who are accomplished professionals, and have excelled in various fields of human endeavor. These Esan sons and daughters are united in confronting the challenge of liberating their motherland from the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy and under development. They are determined to deploy their professional competences and skills to improve the living standard of their motherland. Towards this, AEP adopted a number of measures, and these include the establishment of a special purpose vehicle - the AEP Education Foundation Trust Fund, to
                        enable the Association intervene, in a structured and sustainable manner, in the promotion and development of education in Esanland because we are convinced that the only way to ensure that Esan people remain relevant in the ever changing world is to evolve enduring strategy for the education of its sons and daughters from generation to generation.
