                           The graduation of twenty (20) Esan youths from Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Delta State with international certification in welding and fabrication after a nine-month training is part of the various milestones in the journey to Esanland capacity building and industrialization championed by the Association of Esan Professionals
                        (AEP).

                            From inception in 2001, the Association of Esan Professionals (AEP) was clearly focused on empowering Esan people through rapid social and economic development of Esanland, mobilizing and facilitating youths and human capital development as well as fostering the spirit of unity and a sense of oneness among all Esan people.

                            This vision combined with the desire to emancipate Esanland from the vicious cycle of poverty inspired the institution of Esan Economic Empowerment Workshop (EEEW), a summit aimed at promoting economic revival and infrastructural development of Esanland.

                            In July 2017, AEP signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the management of PTI on skill acquisition for Esan youths. Pursuant to that MoU, the Association has so far sent two batches of young graduates of Esan extraction to the institute for a nine-month training in the acquisition of special skills in welding and fabrication techniques under the Association’s Skill Acquisition Programme.
