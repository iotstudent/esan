                            AEP’s vision combined with the desire to emancipate Esanland from the vicious cycle of poverty inspired the
                            institution
                            of Esan Economic Empowerment Workshop (EEEW), a summit aimed at promoting economic revival and
                            infrastructural
                            development of Esanland. On October 2, 2004, Ambrose Alli Hall, Ekpoma (Esan West L.G.A.) hosted the first
                            ever EEEW
                            under the distinguished chairmanship of the revered global icon, Chief Anthony Enahoro, OFR. The founding
                            President of
                            AEP, Chief Lawson Omokhodion enthused about mobilizing “Esan business elite towards developing the
                            investment
                            opportunities in Esanland” therein providing a platform for sharing best practices and a cross-fertilization
                            of ideas on
                            how to deal with critical developmental challenges facing Esanland.

                    The EEEW was hosted in turns, on a rational basis by the five (5) Local Government Areas (LGA) that make up Esanland,
                    namely; Esan West LGA, Ekpoma; Esan North East LGA, Uromi; Esan Central LGA, Irrua; Esan South East, Ubiaja; and Igueben
                    LGA, Igueben respectively. From the above, it was conceptually expedient that the next five (5) EEEWs, spanning over
                    five years were devoted to agriculture, agribusiness and vocational investments. Worthy of note are the EEEW in Irrua,
                    Ubiaja and Ekpoma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the heels of the aforementioned potentials in Esanland, the 3rd EEEW in Irrua on September 30, 2006 sought to, among
                    others, engage the local people, trade groups, the private sector and communities through dialogue to start the formal
                    training to extension services; while also focusing on source of funding cooperative groups for development. Titled
                    “Implementing the Vision of Building Groups for Economic Empowerment using Cooperatives as Tools, the workshop attracted
                    over one thousand (1,000) participants and about forty-two (42) cooperative societies including herdsmen from Northern
                    Nigeria who live and engaged in cattle trading across major cities like Uromi and Ekpoma.

                        <p>
                            For this purpose, AEP set up five (5) committees, namely; Poultry Committee chaired by Mr. Emmanuel Ijewere; Cassava
                            Committee chaired by Barr. Matthew Egbadon; Welder/Artisan Trade Association Committee chaired by Chief (Dr.) Leemon
                            Ikpea; Pineapple Committee chaired by Mr. Godday Abumere; and Micro Finance Committee chaired by Chief (Dr.) Pascal
                            Ebhohimen. After the initial keynote paper on “The role of Cooperative in Economic Development of Nigeria, presented by
                            Mr. S. A. Inegbenosun, Deputy Director, Cooperatives, Edo State, the workshop went into break-out sessions of the
                            various committee with a view to drill down on the prospects, challenges and possible assistance from AEP. It must be
                            emphasized that the successes of the 3rd EEEW in Irrua gave birth to various initiatives. However, it is important to
                            note, that the Welder/Artisan Trade Association Committee which was chaired by Chief (Dr.) Leemon Ikpea laid the
                            foundation for the AEP sponsored PTI training that we celebrate today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking a cue from the successes of the Irrua workshop, the 4th EEEW in Ubiaja on September 28, 2007 push the boundary
                            from ideas and thought process to actual execution and implementation in a visible look and feel. Themed ‘Nucleus Estate
                            Initiative: Empowering Coopertives in Esanland, the Chairman of the Poultry Committee at the Irrua workshop, Mr.
                            Emmanuel Ijewere in conjunction with the Poultry Farmers Association led by Engr. Omoria Iyomon collaborated with the
                            Association of Esan Professionals (AEP) to promote Virgin Foods Nigeria Limited, a Nucleus Estate Initiative for the
                            processing, packaging and marketing of poultry products. The ultra-modern processing plant which was commissioned by the
                            then Governor of Edo State had the capacity to process birds and other poultry products to assured quality standards for
                            the entire South-South and South-East regions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In continuation of the capacity building in agricbusiness and vocational opportunities, AEP again collaborated with
                            Uhiele Farms Training Centre (UFTC) promoted by Engr. Charles Osezua. The process commenced with a train-the-trainer
                            programme, who was then enrolled in Shongai Farms Centre, Port Novo, Benin Republic to acquire requisite skills and
                            henceforth, train participants. The UFTC was designed as a community-based crop and animal production enterprise
                            development programme aimed at providing practical and interactive leadership training and management courses in crop
                            production and animal husbandry – poultry/piggery while offering starter packs or grants to best performing
                            participants. In 2008, over 28 participants drawn from across Esanland and beyond were accommodated in Uhiele Farms for
                            a period of ten (10) months or weeks to be trained on improved farming techniques and agric-business process. This
                            naturally dovetailed into the 6th EEEW in Ekpoma titled “Positioning Esanland for Emerging Opportunities in Agro-allied
                            Industries”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a period of six years, spanning the 7th to the 12th EEEW, AEP focused on education and Esan cultural
                            values/language. In the area of education, worthy of note is the enormous data gathering on the decay of educational
                            infrastructure by Mr. Mike Osime, then President of AEP, in the five (5) LGAs in Esanland which prompted Edo State
                            Government’s intervention that led to the now famous “Red Roof” across the entire Edo State.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the 2017 EEEW, capacity building in agricbusiness and vocational potentials in Esanland regained centre stage at the
                            Uromi workshop themed “Modernizing Agricbusiness in Esanland for Economic Empowerment” Boosted by the current drive by
                            the Federal Government on Agribusiness as well as our vision to empower Esan people, AEP, like 2006, reached out to
                            cooperative societies and trade associations. In total, 37 cooperatives and 166 guests attended the Day One event which
                            had farmers’ training session.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In July 2017, AEP, led by Barr. Matthew Egbadon, the immediate past president signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
                            with the management of PTI on skill acquisition for Esan youths. Pursuant to that MoU, the Association has so far sent
                            two batches of young graduates of Esan extraction to the institute for a nine-month training in the acquisition of
                            special skills in welding and fabrication techniques under the Association’s Skill Acquisition Programme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is worthy of note that the globally acclaimed fame of Esanland and its people, over the years, came from Education
                            and Agriculture. In recognition of this fact, AEP has devoted every edition of their annual Esan Economic Empowerment
                            Workshop (EEEW) to these two sectors as follows:

                    <p>
                        First l must thank the Association of Esan Professionals (AEP) based in Lagos, for inviting me to be the Guest Speaker
                        and for putting together this workshop which some of us deem long overdue, given the urgency of the matter at hand. Esan
                        language, like many small group languages, is in dire straits and has been crying for the attention of its owners. A few
                        Esan people had paid attention in the past and have done a lot but more needs to be done if the language is to be
                        salvaged from certain death. It is a question of time and time is running out. Once again, l thank the AEP for
                        organising this workshop as it is better late than not.

                            From its inception in 2001, our Association has been driven by the sole objective to provide a common politically
                            non-partisan platform for all Esan Professionals to contribute their quota to the socio-economic and cultural
                            development of Esanland and its people. Since then, we have had cause to intervene in, and on several occasions, raised
                            debates on matters, affecting the lives of Esan people.
