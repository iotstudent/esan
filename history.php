                            Esan sons and daughters are renowned, worldwide, for their outspokenness, enlightened communal interest, principled values and spirit of emancipation from socio-political challenges. Back in the 1950s when most Africans were rarely heard and colonialism was accepted as the political norm, an Esan man, a revered global icon, Chief Anthony Enahoro
                            moved the famous motion for independence to liberate the most populous black nation on earth, Nigeria, from colonialism. <p></p>
                            Today, that irrepressible and indomitable spirit of Esan man and woman still abound! Thus, it was not a surprise that I 2001, Esan sons and daughters again rose to the challenge of liberating their motherland. From the vicious circle of poverty, illiteracy and under-development. United by this common vision, these sons and daughters, who are core professionals in their chosen careers, are determined to deploy their professional competences and skills to improve the
                            living standard of their motherland. <p></p>
                            A series of meeting at the residence of Dr. G.A.T. Oboh (Former Group Mananging Director, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC)
                            culminated in the emergence of the first President of the Association of Esan Professionals (AEP), Chief Lawson
                            Azekhuoria Omokhodion. His leadership (2001-2004) instituted the Esan Economic Empowerment Workshop (EEEW) with the aim
                            of promoting economic revival and infrastructural development of Esanland. The EEW in its 16 years of existence, has
                            been hosted at the headquarters of all the five Local Government Areas in Esanland, namely, Ekpoma, Uromi, Irrua,
                            Ubiajia and Igueben.

                    At the election of 2005, the Rt, Honourable (Engr.) Charles Osezua, KSG, OON was elected AEP’s second President. Seeking
                    better empowerment for Esan people, his administration leveraged on Co-operatives Societies as catalyst of growth in an agrarian society like Esanland. Esan framers (male & female) were trained in improved agricultural processes for higher yield. Thereafter, they were encouraged with soft loans from the Association to help reduce youth unemployment, guaranty food security and ensure economic empowerment of Esan people. <p></p>
                    Still focused on empowering Esan people, Mr. Michael Osime, third President (2009-2014) of AEP devoted his tenure to
                    addressing the falling standard of education at both learning and infrastructural dimensions. His administration started
                    out with a detailed audit of the state of Education in Esanland with the view to identifying the gaps for intervention
                    by the Association. This yielded immediate fruit as both Edo State Government and AEP members contributed to raise the
                    bar. Specifically, AEP members ensured the posting of NYSC teachers to Esanland, by the provision of free accommodation
                    and monthly stipend to the corps; donation of laptops and books to the five Local Government Areas, and the introduction
                    of inter-school quiz and essay competition among the Local Government Areas to ensure excellence. <p></p>
                    On June 22, 2014, Barr. Matthew Egbadon was elected AEP’s fourth President (2014-2018). It is was not by accident that
                    the first major activity of his administration was the launch of AEP Education Foundation Trust Fund. He shared in the
                    spirit of his predecessor in office, and he believes that an educated man or woman is a liberated person. Under the AEP
                    Education Foundation Trust Fund, two batches of twenty (20) Esan youths selected across the five Local Government Areas
                    in Esanland were trained in pipeline welding at the Petroleum Training Institute, Effurrun, Warri, Delta State and
                    certified as International Pipeline Welders. <p></p>
                    AEP’s fifth President, Mr. Sam Obaze (July 2018 – December 2018) was elected on July 1, 2018. His administration was
                    passionate about empowering Esan powering Esan people through skill acquisition and vocational training. Following a
                    meeting with the Edo State Governor, H.E. Mr. Godwin Obaseki, he initiated an audit of the Primary Health Care in
                    Esanland with the view of identifying the gaps for intervention by the government. <p></p>
                    On January 20, 2019, Mr. Efe Akhigbe was elected AEP’s sixth President. Sustaining AEP’s focus on Education, his
                    administration embarks on the launch of a ₦250million Education Endowment Fund for indigent brilliant students of Esan extraction. The project is a merit based yearly scholarship for indigent Esan pupils/students who have no hope of financing their education.
